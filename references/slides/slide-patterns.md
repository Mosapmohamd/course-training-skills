# Slide Patterns

Used by: `slide-designer` (Stage 1 — instructional content). Stage 2 (visual
generation) is governed by `config/presentation-style.md`, not this file.

## Rule: instructional content vs. visual design stay separate

This file governs *what a slide says and shows conceptually*. It never
specifies fonts, colors, or layout pixel positions — that's Stage 2.

## Slide types and when to use them

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| Concept | Introducing a new idea, one idea per slide |
| Visual explanation | A process, architecture, or relationship best shown, not told |
| Example | A concrete instance of the concept just introduced |
| Diagram | Structural/relational information (flow, hierarchy, sequence) |
| Definition | A term that needs a precise, quotable definition |
| Process | Ordered steps |
| Comparison | Two or more options/approaches side by side |
| Question | A prompt for the audience — pairs with an activity |
| Instructions | What to do for an upcoming activity/exercise |
| Exercise | The exercise prompt itself, projected during practice time |
| Recap | End-of-section or end-of-session summary |

## Per-slide required fields

`Slide Number, Title, Purpose, Main Content, Visual Recommendation, Speaker
Notes, Interaction`. See `templates/slide-template.md`.

- **Purpose** — one sentence: what this slide accomplishes in the learning
  sequence (not "shows X" — "establishes why X matters before demo").
- **Main Content** — the actual text/bullets, kept minimal (see below).
- **Visual Recommendation** — described, not designed: "diagram: 3-box flow
  showing input → model → output" not a rendered image.
- **Speaker Notes** — what the instructor says, not what's on the slide restated.
- **Interaction** — none, or a named interaction (poll, question, pause for
  activity, live demo).

## Content discipline

- Avoid text-heavy slides: prefer ≤6 bullets, ≤8 words per bullet as a
  default ceiling; move detail to Speaker Notes.
- Do not copy instructor notes verbatim onto the slide (`README.md` §38) —
  the slide is the visual anchor, the notes are what's *said*.
- Do not simply restate the course outline as slide titles — each slide earns
  its place by doing something (teach, show, ask, transition).

## Stage 2 handoff contract

Stage 1 output (the spec) is the only input Stage 2 may use for instructional
content. Stage 2 may not invent new content, only design how the specified
content is presented. If the presentation/design capability is unavailable,
stop after Stage 1 and say so plainly — do not fabricate a `.pptx`.
