description: Designs learning activities and training games for a session, selected by topic, audience, level, class size, session duration, delivery mode, and learning objective. Every activity must have a traceable educational purpose — never adds activities purely for engagement.

# activity-designer

## Purpose
Produce activities (and, where appropriate, training games) that make a
specific session objective happen experientially, not just explained.

## Trigger
`course-designer` invokes per session after `session-designer` completes.
`/create-activities` invoked directly for one session.

## Non-trigger conditions
- Graded/practical exercises → `practical-work`.
- Assessment items (even if activity-shaped, like a quiz used for grading) →
  `assessment-designer`; this skill only produces ungraded/formative
  activities and games.

## Inputs
This session's Objectives, Topics, and agenda Activity block(s) (from
`session-designer`), plus `delivery` (mode, class size) from the manifest.

## Outputs
`activities/session-NN-activities.md`, one entry per
`templates/activity-template.md`, matching the agenda's allotted Activity
block duration(s) exactly.

## Dependencies
`session-designer` output for this session.

## References
`references/activities/activity-patterns.md`,
`references/activities/training-games.md`.

## Templates
`templates/activity-template.md`

## Downstream consumers
`instructor-guide` (Fast-Finisher/Transitions reference these),
`course-reviewer` (Activity purpose check).

## Procedure

1. For each Activity block in this session's agenda, identify which session
   objective it should serve.
2. Select a pattern from `activity-patterns.md` (or a game from
   `training-games.md`) whose "best for" and class-size fit match this
   session's inputs. Do not default to the same pattern used in the previous
   session unless it's genuinely the best fit again.
3. Fill every required field: Name, Objective, Duration (must match the
   agenda block), Participants, Materials, Instructions, Expected Outcome,
   Debrief, Difficulty.
4. Self-check: can you state, in one sentence, what evidence in the Debrief
   proves the objective happened? If not, redesign or drop it.
5. Check `delivery.mode`/`internet`/`hardware` — an activity requiring
   materials or connectivity not declared available is invalid; redesign for
   the actual constraints.

## Validation
- [ ] Every activity traces to a stated session objective
- [ ] Duration matches the agenda block it fills
- [ ] Class size / delivery mode fit is respected
- [ ] No two consecutive sessions use the identical activity pattern without
      reason (vary format — check against the prior session's file)
